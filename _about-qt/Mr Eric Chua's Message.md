	<p class="description">Queenstown is named after Queen Elizabeth II to commemorate her coronation in 1953.  
  
In a place packed with rich history and heritage, QT is a place of many firsts. 1st satellite new town in Singapore, 1st full-time Branch Library built by NLB, Singaporeâ€™s 1st technical school.  
  
Today, Queenstown is a thriving community home to people from all walks of life, coming from different backgrounds. A myriad of historical landmarks, its rich history, heritage and diveristy, makes Queenstown such a unique and special place. And we hope to create many more memorable firsts with our QTs!</p>
